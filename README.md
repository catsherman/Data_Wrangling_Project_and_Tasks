# Data_Wrangling_Project_and_Tasks

The purpose of this repository is to organize and showcase projects that I've completed in QBS 181: Data Wrangling. This repository contains R and SQL code that was written throughout the course. I was given permission to make my work public.

Sub-Directory Descriptions: 

•	inClassExercises: There are 8 short coding exercises in this folder. Their goal was to practice skills we learned in class that day. Their topics include practice SQL queries, querying SQL databases from R, using dplyr in R, and text/web scraping.  

•	Hw1_project: This homework was strictly with SQL, and focuses on SQL queries, joins, working with dates and creating new columns.

•	Hw2_project: This homework used both SQL and R. It focused on executing SQL queries from R, and executing similar commands as in homework 1 but from R.

•	Hw3_project: This homework uses R exclusively. It focused on using dplyr, tidyr, and transferring what we learned about manipulating data in SQL to R.

•	Midterm Exam: This folder includes the code used on my midterm exam. The goal of the exam was to clean a given data set with the SQL and R tools that we learned earlier in the course.

•	Final Exam: This folder includes code used on my final exam. The goal was to update a table in a databse based on the content of a csv file, and to restructure the data with R and SQL to answer given questions.
